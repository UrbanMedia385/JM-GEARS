  <h3>Ore Grinding Mill</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Our last category of the horizontal mills includes the ore grinding mill to crush the ore particles into desired sizes. This process might sound similar to other heavy material processing; however is called comminution. </li>
    <li>The process of comminution is connected with reducing the material’s size into very small pieces. Comminution, in simple words, is a process of reducing a material’s particle size, aiming to extract valuable minerals.</li>
    <li>Our grinding mills work as large crushing balls to break the heavy materials into smaller pieces. As the grinding action between the ore and the steel machines takes place, a powder of fine particles is created.</li>
    <li>These ore grinding mills are critical for the mining operations, wherein the size of the steel rods matters. This mill includes autogenous (AG), semi-autogenous (SAG) mills, ball mills, rod mills and other specialized equipment</li>
    <li>Hence,<strong><a href=""> JM Gears & Engineering </a> </strong> products are essential for maximizing mineral processing efficiency. This efficiency is guaranteed by our downstream processes in mining operations, where our precised engineering equipment ensure maximum consistency.</li>
