  <h3>SAG Mill (Semi-Autogenous Grinding)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>SAG Mills are also one of the large rotating cylinders used primarily in mining operations of semi-autogenous grinding. In India,<strong><a href="#">horizontal grinding mill manufacturers </a> </strong> process minerals like gold, copper, ores, and nickel etc.</li>
    <li>These types of mills are operated by motioning the steel rods to process ore material into fine particles. Specifically, these mills are used for grinding large pieces of rock and ore from the most modern practices.</li>
    <li>Interestingly, this mill uses the ore itself to crush its other pieces into fine particles to extract valuable materials. We push this step forward by adding steel balls as per the millâ€™s volume for proper mixing</li>
    <li>This process is called the Semi-Autogenous Grinding, where the grinding power is increased to easily break down the heavy materials. This is done to increase the cost-efficiency of the products we utilize in providing grinding mill solutions.</li>
