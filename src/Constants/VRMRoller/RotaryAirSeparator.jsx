    <h3>Rotary Air Separator</h3>
    <p>
    A Rotary Air Separator is a device used in a mill to separate materials based on their size. After grinding, a mixture of fine powder and coarser material is blown upwards into the separator. 
    </p>
    <p>The separator has rotating blades that create a vortex, much like a centrifuge. The lighter, fine powder gets carried away by the airflow and exits as the final product. The heavier, coarser particles are too heavy to be carried and fall back down onto the grinding table to be reground. This process ensures a consistent and high-quality final product.
