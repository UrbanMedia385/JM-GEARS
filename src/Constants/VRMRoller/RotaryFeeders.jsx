      <h3>Rotary Feeders</h3>
      <p>
      Rotary feeders are devices used to ensure a constant and controlled flow of material into the mill. They typically consist of a rotating paddle or star-shaped wheel inside a housing. As the wheel turns, it traps a specific amount of material in its pockets and releases it into the mill. This process prevents blockages and ensures a consistent feed rate. A consistent flow of material is crucial for maintaining stable mill operation and producing a high-quality product, as it prevents the mill from becoming overloaded or running empty.
