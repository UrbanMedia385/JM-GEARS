    <h3>Grinding Table</h3>
    <p>
    The grinding table is a large, rotating dish inside a Vertical Roller Mill. It serves as the platform where raw material is ground into a fine powder. As the grinding table turns, the material is fed onto its surface. The heavy grinding rollers then roll over the material, crushing it against the table. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The grinding table is built to be extremely durable and wear-resistant, as it must withstand the continuous pressure and abrasive action of the rollers. It's a critical component that facilitates the primary grinding process.
