   <h3>VRM Roller Hub/Grinding Roller</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The VRM roller hub is the heart of a Vertical Roller Mill. It holds the grinding rollers, which are massive, wheel-shaped components. These rollers rotate and press down on the grinding table with immense force.</li>
    <li>Their job is to crush and grind large pieces of raw material, such as limestone or cement clinker, into a fine powder. The grinding rollers are made from incredibly tough materials to withstand the extreme pressure and abrasion, making them a key component for the efficiency and output of the mill.</li>
