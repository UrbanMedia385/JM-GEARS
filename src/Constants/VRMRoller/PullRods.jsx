    <h3>Pull Rods & Tie Rods</h3>
    <p>
    Pull rods and tie rods are vital components of a mill's hydraulic system. They are high-strength steel rods that connect the mill's rollers to its main frame. Their primary function is to transmit the immense force from the hydraulic cylinders to the grinding rollers. This force is what presses the rollers against the grinding table to crush the material. By allowing for precise control of the pressure, these rods ensure efficient grinding and prevent damage to the mill. They are essential for both the grinding power and the structural integrity of the mill.
