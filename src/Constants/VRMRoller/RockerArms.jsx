    <h3>Rocker Arms & Rotary Arms</h3>
    <p>
    Rocker arms and rotary arms are part of the mechanical system that positions and applies pressure to the grinding rollers. The rocker arms pivot, acting as levers to transfer the force from the hydraulic cylinders to the pull rods, which in turn push the rollers down onto the grinding table. They are key to controlling the grinding force. Rotary arms are the structural components that hold the grinding rollers in place and allow them to spin. Together, these arms form the framework that allows the rollers to move, apply pressure, and efficiently grind the raw material.
