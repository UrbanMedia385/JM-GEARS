      <h3>Hammer Crushers: Power in Every Blow</h3>
      <p>
    A hammer crusher is designed for industries needing heavy-duty size reduction through impact. 
    This type of crusher uses rotating hammers to crush feed material from raw form (such as limestone, coal, gypsum, and shale) 
    into uniform particles, which are ready to feed into a cement kiln, a steel furnace, or a blow boiler in a power plant.
  </p>

  <h3>It features:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>High-energy Impact:</strong> It quickly reduces material for efficient size reduction.</li>
    <li><strong>Heavy-duty build:</strong> Designed for wear resistance for all-day performance</li>
    <li><strong>High Throughput:</strong> Aggregate bulk raw materials quickly and easily.</li>
    <li><strong>Low-maintenance:</strong> Built for continuous industrial applications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Industries/Applications:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cement Plants:</strong> Petro-charging for kiln feed; limestone has to be prepared with a proper clay mix prior to feeding into a kiln.</li>
    <li><strong>Steel Industry:</strong> Coal and coke need to be properly sized and crushed for furnace operation.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Plants:</strong> Coal must also be crushed for energy production.</li>
    <li><strong>Mining &amp; Minerals:</strong> Proper sizing/crushing and fragmentation of ores and minerals for further processing.</li>
  </ul>
