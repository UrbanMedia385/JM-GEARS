    <h3>Prefab Buildings</h3>
    <p>
    Prefabricated (prefab) buildings are structures whose components are manufactured off-site in a factory and then transported and assembled at the final location. This fabrication method is highly efficient, as it allows for construction to occur simultaneously with site preparation, significantly reducing overall project timelines. Prefab steel buildings are known for their strength, cost-effectiveness, and quality control, as they are built in a controlled environment. They are used for a wide range of applications, including offices, classrooms, and modular housing, offering a faster and often more sustainable alternative to traditional construction.
