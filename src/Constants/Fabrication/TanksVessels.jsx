    <h3>Tanks and Vessels</h3>
    <p>
    Tanks and vessels are containers fabricated from steel or other alloys, designed to hold and process liquids, gases, or other materials under specific pressure conditions. They are a critical part of many industries, including chemical processing, oil and gas, and food production. The fabrication process for these containers is highly specialised, requiring precise welding and quality assurance to ensure they are leak-proof and can safely handle the substances they contain. Their design and construction must comply with strict safety codes to prevent leaks, explosions, or other hazards.
