    <h3>Impellers & Fans</h3>
    <p>
    Impellers and fans are used to move air and gas within industrial systems. An impeller is a rotating part of a pump or a fan that creates pressure and airflow. Fans are used in mills and kilns to pull hot gas through the system, dry raw materials, and transport fine-grained products. These components are essential for air classification, which separates fine particles from coarse ones, and for ensuring the correct airflow for the combustion and drying processes.
