    <h3>Wobbler Shaft</h3>
    <p>
    A wobbler shaft is a specialised shaft used in a wobbler feeder, which is a type of material screening and feeding equipment. The shaft is designed with an eccentric or "wobbling" motion. When the shaft rotates, the bars of the feeder move in a tumbling motion, causing the material to be agitated. This motion separates larger lumps from smaller particles, allowing the larger pieces to be fed to a crusher while the smaller ones fall through, thus improving the efficiency of the crushing process.
