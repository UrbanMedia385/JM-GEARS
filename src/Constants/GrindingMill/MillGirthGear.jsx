    <h3>Mill Girth Gear</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The mill girth gear is a massive, circular gear ring that is bolted to the exterior of a rotary mill. It is the largest single component of the mill's drive system. Its teeth mesh with the smaller pinion gear, allowing the entire mill to rotate. </li>
      <li>Girth gears are often made in segments for easier transportation and installation and are typically crafted from high-quality cast or forged steel to withstand the immense forces involved in grinding. Its size and robust construction are essential for the continuous, heavy-duty operation of the mill.</li>
    </ul>
