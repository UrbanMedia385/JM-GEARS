    <h3>Mill Pinion</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Mill Pinion is a gear responsible for driving the rotation of the mill shell in grinding mills, essential for the comminution of raw materials in cement and steel production.</li>
      <li>Its small size allows it to translate the high speed of the motor into the low speed and high torque needed to turn the massive mill. The pinion's health is critical for the efficiency of the entire grinding process.</li>
