    <h3>Mill Shell</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The mill gear is the main drive system for a rotary mill. It consists of a large girth gear and a smaller pinion gear. The purpose of this system is to transfer high torque from a motor to the mill shell, causing it to rotate and grind materials like clinker, coal, or ore. </li>
    <li>This gear system is vital because it must operate under immense load and stress, requiring precise manufacturing and durable materials. It is the powerhouse that enables the grinding process.
