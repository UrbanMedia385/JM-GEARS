    <h3>Mill Heads (Trunnion Heads)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mill heads are the two end plates of a grinding mill that seal the ends of the cylinder. They are responsible for holding the grinding media (like steel balls or rods) inside and are designed with special openings to allow raw material to be fed into the mill and ground material to be discharged.</li>
      <li>The heads are often equipped with wear-resistant liners to protect the main structure from abrasion. Their design is crucial for managing the flow of material and ensuring the grinding media remains contained, which is vital for the continuous operation of the mill.</li>
    </ul>
