       <h3>Torsion Shaft:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A torsion shaft is a steel rod that connects two machines to run together without damage. When it is connected, the first machine spins quickly and transfers power to the other one. This twisting action absorbs the shock.</li>
    <li>This feature protects sensitive components like gears and bearings from sudden jolts and vibrations. The shaft's flexible design allows it to compensate for minor misalignments between connected machines, reducing stress and wear on the entire system. Because it is a single, solid piece of metal, it is a simple yet highly effective way to ensure smooth and reliable power transmission in a heavy-duty machine.</li>
</ul>
