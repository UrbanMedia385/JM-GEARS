     <h3>Bearing Housings:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bearing housings protect the supporting rollers. Enclosed in a metal casing, this keeps the supporting rollers in place against the heavy pressure. Typically built from cast steel or iron, bearing housings are a safe enclosure that withstands daily wear and tear.</li>
    <li>At JM Gears, our available bearing housings are designed with advanced casting and machining processes for a wear-resistant product. With our lubricated and well-maintained bearings, you can always ensure to improve your machineâ€™s efficiency.</li>
