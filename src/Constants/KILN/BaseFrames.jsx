       <h3>Base Frames:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A base frame is a rigid, structural foundation used to support and precisely align industrial machinery. It acts as a stable platform for mounting components like motors, gearboxes, and pumps, ensuring they remain in their correct position during operation.</li>
    <li>By providing a flat, secure surface, a base frame minimises vibrations and prevents the equipment from shifting. This precise alignment is crucial for efficient power transmission and for preventing premature wear on shafts and bearings. Ultimately, a well-built base frame guarantees that heavy machinery is securely anchored and operates smoothly and safely.</li>
