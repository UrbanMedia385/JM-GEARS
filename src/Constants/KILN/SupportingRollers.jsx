       <h3>Supporting Rollers:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Supporting rollers or trunnion rollers, are large steel-made cylinders that support the overall physical weight of the rotary kiln. Besides this, it maintains the load of its internal refractory lining and the processing of raw material inside.</li>
    <li>Forged from high-quality steel alloys, our supporting rollers handle the mechanical stress and weather impact easily. With its slight misalignment, the rollers are able to support the kiln in its correct position. With us, you will always maximise uptime through our efficient<strong><a href="#"> cement plant spare parts </a> </strong> that work to maximise productivity.</li>
