    <h3>High-Quality Kiln Shell </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
      Our premium kiln shell is a large, cylindrical steel component on the outside of the rotary kiln. As the main body of the kiln, it secures the internal lining from outside elements. During the heating, drying or sintering processes, the shell maintains its own and the raw materialâ€™s weight. It, in addition, handles the thermal expansion during the entire process. 
      </li>
      <li>
      At JM Gears, a premium cement and steel plant manufacturer, we build our shells in sections, which makes them easier to install and repair. Investing in our kiln shells means choosing a reliable and long-lasting solution that protects your assets and boosts overall plant productivity.
