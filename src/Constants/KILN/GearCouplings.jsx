   <h3>Gear Couplings:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Connecting two steel rods in a line, gear couplings send power from one shaft to the other. When the first shaft spins, its hub turns the sleeve, and the sleeve's teeth then turn the teeth on the second hub, which makes the second shaft spin.</li>
    <li>Gear couplings are durable and resilient, which makes them a suitable match for factories, power plants, and mines to connect kilns and mills. At JM Gears, our gear couplings are weatherproof and long-lasting for the best running cement mills.</li>
</ul>    </>
