<h3>Rod Mill</h3>
<ul>
    <li>As the name suggests, the ROD Mill operates horizontally with steel rods grinding the materials to produce uniform-sized particles. These are effective in industries specializing in mining and gear manufacturing.</li>
    <li>The ROD Mill is considerably similar to the Ball mill; however, it can be differentiated based on the mill size. Ball mills are cylindrical in shape, but ROD mills consist of long steel rods to crush the 1-4 mm size. </li>
    <li>In the ROD Mill, the crushing process takes place through line contact to be maintained between the rods. Hence, our steel rods can be crushed to a diameter of 50-100 mm, as they are made from high-carbon steel.</li>
    <li>Furthermore, our<strong><a href="#"> Horizontal Grinding Mill Solutions </a> </strong>are also manufactured for wet grinding. The slurry substance can successfully be added to the mill to grind the materials into fine particles.</li>
    <li>Our ROD Mills are commonly used to prepare feed material, which can also support the ball mill processing. We recommend this type of mill solution for processing a wide range of materials under one roof.</li>
